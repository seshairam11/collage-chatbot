first wee need to upgrade all the dependencies to its max 

	npx expo install --check 

--check is for seeing the current version and available version






and add those dependencies

npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-gesture-handler react-native-svg






if your using eas build create the eas.json and add this 

{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 16.14.1",
    "appVersionSource": "remote"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}

if we don't create it, its automatialy create it but the format is not in apk,  it was in aab format






or 





we can created internally in the system with...,
 install the Eclipse Adoptium

$env:JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.15.6-hotspot"  # Adjust this if installed elsewhere
$env:PATH="$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"







pls change the file path and check with this commend

java -version


when its works it will show like this 

openjdk version "17.0.15" 2025-04-15 
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.15+6 (build 17.0.15+6)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.15+6 (build 17.0.15+6, mixed mode, sharing)






make a prebuild 

npx expo prebuild







and change the directory to android

cd android







to create the apk use this commend

.\gradlew.bat clean
.\gradlew.bat app:assembleRelease -x lint -x test --configure-on-demand --build-cache -PreactNativeDevServerPort=8081






add path \frontend\android\app\build\outputs\apk\release

apk name was app-release.apk
